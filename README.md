# Video-Game-App

Welcome to my first ever Video Game App.


The premise and the structure of the app is very simple and is intended to be used my users of all ages.

The landing pages consists of the libiray that has been pre-built. But Users are able to delete pre-added games and add their own.

When clicked on "View" the user is then taken to the games respective page. 
On the page the user is able to view a gif of said game, 
its name, the rating, a small review & a Youtube video that showcases gameplay/trailer.

When the user adds a new game, they are taken to a form page. Here they will fill in the respestive form fields.
